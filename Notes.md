## Literals
 
  - Integers (int()) = Whole numbers that can be either positive or negative
  - Floats (float()) = Numbers with decimal
  - Strings (str()) = Words/phrases contained in " "
  - Boolean (bool()) = True or False this literal is case sensitive

## Variables

### Variable Naming

- Should be lowercase and multiple words should be seperated by an underscore
  - <mark> ex. my_variable </mark>
- Function names use same conventions
- Camelcase is allowed if needed for backwards compatibility 
  - <mark> ex. myVariable </mark>

### Creating a Variable

variables are created by using the assignment operator ( = )\
<mark> ex. my_variable = "something"</mark>

## Comments

- Anything after ( # ) is ignored by Python
- Best practice is to comment and explain each piece of important code
- Can be used to turn on and off sections of code you're testing
- To quickly comment or comment blocks of code use keyboard shortcut <strong> ctrl + \ </strong>
