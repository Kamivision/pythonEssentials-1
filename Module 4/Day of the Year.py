# Objectives
# Familiarize the student with:

# projecting and writing parameterized functions;
# utilizing the return statement;
# building a set of utility functions;
# utilizing the student's own functions.
# Scenario
# Your task is to write and test a function which takes three arguments (a year, a month, and a day of the month) and returns the corresponding day of the year, or returns None if any of the arguments is invalid.

# Use the previously written and tested functions. Add some test cases to the code. This test is only a beginning.

def is_year_leap(year):
#
# Your code from LAB 4.3.1.6.
#

def days_in_month(year, month):
#
# Your code from LAB 4.3.1.7.
#

def day_of_year(year, month, day):
#
# Write your new code here.
#

print(day_of_year(2000, 12, 31))
